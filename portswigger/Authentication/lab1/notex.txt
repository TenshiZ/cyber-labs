Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

 This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

    Candidate usernames
    Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page. 

valid users:

16	ec2-user	200	141	false	false	3250	

others are 3248 length

valid passwords: 

5	123456789	302	142	false	false	190	

others are 3237
