Lab: Password brute-force via password change

 This lab's password change functionality makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. To solve the lab, use the list of candidate passwords to brute-force Carlos's account and access his "My account" page.

    Your credentials: wiener:peter
    Victim's username: carlos 

when we want to change our passwords this are the hidden fields

username=wiener&current-password=peter new-password-1=peter1&new-password-2=peter1

lets try changging wiener to carlos

didnt work, we need the password too,
we cant make the brute-forced in the login because it lets u only one attempt

lets do it in the change password

we notice that if we put different new password we can know if the current password is correct 

77	cheese	200	150	false	false	4013	Current password is incorrect	

57	112233	200	536	false	false	4010	New passwords do not match
