Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses

 This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

    Candidate usernames
    Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page. 


valid users:

60	americas	200	153	false	false	3339	Invalid username or password 		

response has no . in the "Invalid username or password."


valid passwords:

99	moon	302	206	false	false	190
