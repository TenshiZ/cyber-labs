Lab: File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

 This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.

The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.

To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file. 

They block traversal path so lets try using /etc/passwd directly

DONE :D
