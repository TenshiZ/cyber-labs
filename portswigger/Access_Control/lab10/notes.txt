Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

 This lab has user account page that contains the current user's existing password, prefilled in a masked input.

To solve the lab, retrieve the administrator's password, then use it to delete the user carlos.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter
