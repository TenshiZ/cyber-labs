# Notes — THM/Defensive Tools Intro

## Tools Summary
- Shodan → devices, IoT, ICS.
- Censys → hosts, certs, domains.
- VirusTotal → malware/file/hash analysis.

- CVE/NVD → vulnerability references.
- ExploitDB/GitHub → PoCs and exploit code.
- man → Linux built-in manual.
- MS Docs → official Windows command docs.

## Observations
- Shodan ≠ Censys (different focus).
- VirusTotal combines results from 67+ AVs.
- CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed) used as case study.
- GitHub is a rich source of PoCs, but needs careful validation.
- Official docs are always the ground truth.

## Next Steps
- Practice searching CVEs in NVD.
- Use Shodan free account for hands-on queries.
- Explore more SIEM integrations with VirusTotal/HIBP.
